## Business Intelligence - three different types of regression models

## In our assignment, we got three different types of regression, which are:

## Types of Regression:
* Simple Linear Regression: Models a linear relationship between one independent variable and the target variable. 
* Multiple Linear Regression: Extends simple linear regression to multiple independent variables. 
* Polynomial Regression: Introduces polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.

## Challenges:
Some of the challenges could be:
* Missing Data: Dealing with missing values in the dataset. 
* Outliers: Identifying and handling outliers in the data. The outliers affect the training of a regression model. 
* Overfitting/Underfitting: Balancing the complexity of the model. 

## Accuracy:
* The lower the RMSE is the better. In our model, we check on price, our RMSE is about 27000 dollars, and we think that is OK based on the average house price being 540088 dollars. 
* Our R-squared is currently standing at about 0,5 which could be a lot better. R-squared should typically be as close to 1 as possible and therefore we have a lot more to go.

## Further Improvement:
There is a lot that can be done better, but here is just some key points that may make it better:
* Outlier Handling
* Different Algorithms
* Additional Data
